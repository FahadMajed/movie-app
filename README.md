# Movie App API

Welcome to the Movie Reservation System API documentation. This API allows you to manage movie listings, check availability for time slots, and reserve time slots for movies.

## System Overview

Our movie booking system provides the following key features:

- **User Registration and Authentication**: Users can register for an account and securely sign in using their credentials.

- **Movie Management**: You can create and manage movies, including setting up time slots for showings.

- **Reservation**: Users can reserve time slots for movies, subject to seat availability.

- **Capacity Management**: The system tracks remaining capacity for each time slot to prevent overbooking.

I am happy to discuss any design or architectural decision made in the app, such as the testing strategy, why I introduced repositories, splitting between entities and schemas, the folder structure, and the choice of TypeORM to name few.

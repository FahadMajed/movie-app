## Ensuring Data Integrity in a Movie Reservation System

Maintaining data integrity is crucial for ensuring accurate and consistent movie reservations. This system is designed to handle potential data inconsistencies, which can lead to issues like overbooking or conflicting reservations.

### Strategies for Maintaining Data Integrity

1. **Concurrency Control**:
    - To prevent race conditions and ensure data consistency, the system employs a versioning mechanism.
    - Each movie record maintains a version number that is incremented with each update.
    - This mechanism helps to detect conflicts, ensuring that only one reservation is processed for a given time slot.

2. **Atomic Updates**:
    - The system utilizes atomic updates for reservation transactions.
    - During a reservation, the `bookedCount` of a time slot is incremented atomically, along with the version number update.
    - This approach prevents scenarios where multiple reservations might overlap, exceeding the available capacity.

### Implementation of Optimistic Concurrency Control

The system uses an optimistic concurrency control approach, which operates as follows:

- When a reservation is attempted, the current version of the movie record is retrieved.
- The system then checks if the requested time slot is available by verifying the version number and time slot existence.
- If the conditions are met, it proceeds to update the `bookedCount` atomically, ensuring consistent data updates.

Here's a simplified code snippet demonstrating this approach:

```javascript
async attemptReservation(movieId: any, timeSlotId: number, numberOfPeople: number): Promise<boolean> {
  const movieObjectId = new ObjectId(movieId);
  const currentVersion = await this.findMovieVersion(movieId);

  // Check if the movie time slot is valid and available
  const movie = await this.findValidMovie(movieObjectId, timeSlotId, currentVersion);
  if (!movie) {
    return false;
  }

  // Perform an atomic update on the bookedCount and version
  const updateResult = await this.repository.findOneAndUpdate(
    {
      _id: movieObjectId,
      'timeSlots.id': timeSlotId,
      version: currentVersion,
    },
    {
      $inc: { 'timeSlots.$.bookedCount': numberOfPeople },
      $set: { version: currentVersion + 1 }, // Update the version
    },
    { returnDocument: 'after' },
  );

  return updateResult.ok == 1;
}

async findValidMovie(id: any, timeSlotId: number, currentVersion: number) {
  return await this.repository.findOne({
    where: {
      _id: id,
      'timeSlots.id': timeSlotId,
      version: currentVersion,
      $expr: { $lt: ['$timeSlots.bookedCount', '$timeSlots.capacity'] },
    },
  });
}
```
### Conclusion

The implementation of concurrency control and atomic updates in the Movie Reservation System plays a vital role in maintaining data integrity. These strategies ensure that reservations are managed effectively, preventing conflicts and preserving the system's reliability. Future enhancements could focus on scalability and handling increased transaction volumes.
